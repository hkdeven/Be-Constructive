## THE PROBLEM
>The US accounts for 25% of the world's prison population, spending between $60-70k on each prisoner annually (5x more than higher education). After one year from release, 75% are unemployed and over 60% will return to prison. [The Last Mile](http://thelastmile.org/) is an organization that has been providing computer programming skills to inmates for the last five years. The recidivism rate for their students is 0%. Not one former inmate has returned to jail upon release.

## THE SOLUTION
Lacking access to the internet, this program was missing a developer-oriented design tool for students that would provide creative inspiration for course assignments and projects as well as exposure to real-world projects and trends. Students at the Florida-based [Wyncode Academy](https://wyncode.co/), moved by the [The Last Mile's](http://thelastmile.org/) program and success, took on this task as their final project to end their technical training. Building onto this foundation, next steps will include incorporating current tech news, using the Huffington Post's [Huffpost CODE](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huffpost-code/) rss feed, to the resource section. We are also working on a developer-design-oriented blog, The Suave Developer, to provide learning articles on topics ranging from CSS and SASS to Sketch and Codepen-like demos.
